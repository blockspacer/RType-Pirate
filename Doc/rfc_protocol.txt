RFC 2223               R-type communication procotol       December 2019

1.  Introduction

   The goal of this project was to create a multiplayer video game, the
   R-type. 4 players are playing together to survive waves of monsters.
   To faciliate adding new clients to our server, we created a protocol
   that we will describe in this document. First you need to use TCP
   to connect your client to one of our waiting rooms, then when the 
   game starts, you have to handle UDP.

2.  UDP protocol

   As we saw in the introduction, once you are in the game, all the
   communications are handled with UDP protocol. The reason of this
   choice is the speed of the UDP protocol. We have to update client's
   display screen as fast as we can.

   Your client MUST send a packet wich can be cast in a C or structure
   C++ structure (struct). In this structure, we can find 2 fields.
   - fired is a bool that is true if the client fired
   - pos is a pair containing the ID of the client's entity spaceship
   and a pair of float, wich is the client position X Y
   This structure have to be sent everytime the client fire or move.

   Your client MUST be able to receive a packet wich can be cast in a C
   or structure C++ structure (struct). In this structure, we can find 3
   fields :
   - construct, wich is a string containing a newly created entity and
   all his components
   - update, wich is a string containing all the new components values
   - destruct, wich is a string containing ID of entities that have to
   be destroy

   overview :
                    struct my_struct {
                        std::string construct;
                        std::string update;
                        std::string destruct;
                        bool fired;
                        std::pair<unsigned int, std::pair<float, float>> pos;
                    }

3.  Format Rules

   The 3 string in our UDP structures are formated in a special way.
   Your client MUST be able to correctly parse the datas stored in
   this strings. All the datas are separated with a single space

   - destruct is pretty simple, it just cotains a list of ID separated
   by a single space

            example : "4 462 12 765 34 12 949 6 3"

   - construct contains a single entity that have to be created by the
   client. You can read an uppercase keyword (corresponding to a
   component) followed by its value. All separators are single spaces.

            example : "ID 4 HITBOX 13 15 TEAM 1 POSITION 65 23"

   - update contains a list of "construct". It means that you have in
   one string a list of entity with all its components that need to be
   changed. All newly entity description MUST start with ID.

            example : "ID 3 HITBOX 34 65 POSITION 54 ID 2 POSITION 5 56"

4. Keyword description


   Here is the list of Keywords corresponding to a component :
   - KEYWORD variable (variable type)

   Keywords description :
   - POSITION x y (float, float)
   - HEALTH hp (unsigned int)
   - BOUNCE direction (short, short)
   - HORIZAL direction (short int)
   - TEAM id (unsigned int)
   - SCORE points (unsigned int)
   - AUDIO path (string)
   - RANDOMGUN frequence (short int)
   - DRAWABLE path (string)
   - HITBOX x y (unsigned int, unsigned int)
   - INPUTMOVE id (unsigned int)

   3b.  PostScript Format Rules

      Standard page size is 8 1/2 by 11 inches.

      Margin of 1 inch on all sides (top, bottom, left, and right).

      Main text should have a point size of no less than 10 points with
      a line spacing of 12 points.

      Footnotes and graph notations no smaller than 8 points with a line
      spacing of 9.6 points.

      Three fonts are acceptable: Helvetica, Times Roman, and Courier.
      Plus their bold-face and italic versions.  These are the three
      standard fonts on most PostScript printers.

      Prepare diagrams and images based on lowest common denominator
      PostScript.  Consider common PostScript printer functionality and
      memory requirements.

      The following PostScript commands should not be used:
      initgraphics, erasepage, copypage, grestoreall, initmatrix,
      initclip, banddevice, framedevice, nulldevice and renderbands.

      Note that the number of pages in a document and the page numbers
      on which various sections fall will likely differ in the ASCII and
      the PostScript versions.  Thus cross references in the text by
      section number usually are easier to keep consistent than cross
      references by page number.

      These PostScript rules are likely to changed and expanded as
      experience is gained.

      RFCs in PostScript Format may be submitted to the RFC Editor in
      e-mail messages (or as online files).  If you plan to submit a
      document in PostScript please consult the RFC Editor first.

      Note that since the ASCII text version of the RFC is the primary
      version, the PostScript version must match the text version.  The
      RFC Editor must decide if the PostScript version is "the same as"
      the ASCII version before the PostScript version can be published.

4.  Headers and Footers

   There is the first page heading, the running headers, and the running
   footers.

   4a.  First Page

      Please see the front page of this memo for an example of the front
      page heading.  On the first page there is no running header.  The
      top of the first page has the following items:

      Network Working Group

         The traditional heading for the group that founded the RFC
         series.  This appears on the first line on the left hand side
         of the heading.

      Request for Comments: nnnn

         Identifies this as a request for comments and specifies the
         number.  Indicated on the second line on the left side.  The
         actual number is filled in at the last moment before
         publication by the RFC Editor.

      Author

         The author's name (first initial and last name only) indicated
         on the first line on the right side of the heading.

      Organization

         The author's organization, indicated on the second line on the
         right side.

      Date

         This is the Month and Year of the RFC Publication. Indicated on
         the third line on the right side.

      Updates or Obsoletes

         If this RFC Updates or Obsoletes another RFC, this is indicated
         as third line on the left side of the heading.

RFC 2223              Instructions to RFC Authors           October 1997


      Category

         The category of this RFC, one of: Standards Track, Best Current
         Practice, Informational, or Experimental.  This is indicated on
         the third (if there is no Updates or Obsoletes indication) or
         fourth line of the left side.

      Other Numbers

         Other numbers in the RFC series of notes include the subseries
         of FYI (For Your Information) [4], BCP (Best Current Practice)
         [5], and STD (Standard) [6].  These are placed on the left
         side.

      Title

         The title appears, centered, below the rest of the heading.
         Periods or "dots" in the titles are not allowed.

      If there are multiple authors and if the multiple authors are from
      multiple organizations the right side heading may have additional
      lines to accommodate them and to associate the authors with the
      organizations properly.

   4b.  Running Headers

      The running header in one line (on page 2 and all subsequent
      pages) has the RFC number on the left (RFC NNNN), the (possibly
      nshortened form) title centered, and the date (Month Year) on the
      right.

   4c.  Running Footers

      The running footer in one line (on all pages) has the author's
      last name on the left, category centered, and the page number on
      the right ([Page N]).

5.  Status Section

   Each RFC must include on its first page the "Status of this Memo"
   section which contains two elements: (1) a paragraph describing the
   type of the RFC, and (2) the distribution statement.

   The content of this section will be one of the four following
   statements.

7.  Introduction Section

   Each RFC should have an Introduction section that (among other
   things) explains the motivation for the RFC and (if appropriate)
   describes the applicability of the protocol described.

      Normally, this will be the "abstract" section from the Internet
      Draft.  If the RFC is not based on an I-D, other possibilities
      are:

         Protocol

            This protocol is intended to provide the bla-bla service,
            and be used between clients and servers on host computers.
            Typically the clients are on workstation hosts and the
            servers on mainframe hosts.

            or

            This protocol is intended to provide the bla-bla service,
            and be used between special purpose units such as terminal
            servers or routers and a monitoring host.

         Discussion

            The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on particular
            problems in the Internet and possible methods of solution.
            No proposed solutions in this document are intended as
            standards for the Internet.  Rather, it is hoped that a
            general consensus will emerge as to the appropriate solution
            to such problems, leading eventually to the adoption of
            standards.

         Interest

            This RFC is being distributed to members of the Internet
            community in order to solicit their reactions to the
            proposals contained in it.  While the issues discussed may
            not be directly relevant to the research problems of the
            Internet, they may be interesting to a number of researchers
            and implementers.

         Status Report

            In response to the need for maintenance of current
            information about the status and progress of various
            projects in the Internet community, this RFC is issued for
            the benefit of community members.  The information contained
            in this document is accurate as of the date of publication,
            but is subject to change.  Subsequent RFCs will reflect such
            changes.

      These paragraphs need not be followed word for word, but the
      general intent of the RFC must be made clear.

8.  References Section

   Nearly all RFCs contain citations to other documents, and these are
   listed in a References section near the end of the RFC.  There are
   many styles for references, and the RFCs have one of their own.
   Please follow the reference style used in recent RFCs.  See the
   reference section of this RFC for an example.  Please note that for
   protocols that have been assigned STD numbers, the STD number must be
   included in the reference.

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  BCP 14, RFC 2119 [3], defines these words as they
   should be interpreted in IETF documents.

9.  Security Considerations Section

   All RFCs must contain a section near the end of the document that
   discusses the security considerations of the protocol or procedures
   that are the main topic of the RFC.

10.  Author's Address Section

   Each RFC must have at the very end a section giving the author's
   address, including the name and postal address, the telephone number,
   (optional: a FAX number) and the Internet email address.

11.  Copyright Section

   Per BCP 9, RFC 2026 [2], "The following copyright notice and
   disclaimer shall be included in all ISOC standards-related
   documentation."  The following statement should be placed on the last
   page of the RFC, as the "Full Copyright Statement".

      restriction of any kind, provided that the above copyright notice
      and this paragraph are included on all such copies and derivative
      works.  However, this document itself may not be modified in any
      way, such as by removing the copyright notice or references to the
      Internet Society or other Internet organizations, except as needed
      for the purpose of developing Internet standards in which case the
      procedures for copyrights defined in the Internet Standards
      process must be followed, or as required to translate it into

      ENGINEERING TASK FORCE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR

      WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

12.  Relation to other RFCs

   Sometimes an RFC adds information on a topic discussed in a previous
   RFC or completely replaces an earlier RFC.  There are two terms used
   for these cases respectively, Updates and Obsoletes.  A document that
   obsoletes an earlier document can stand on its own.  A document that
   merely updates an earlier document cannot stand on its own; it is
   something that must be added to or inserted into the previously
   existing document, and has limited usefulness independently.  The
   terms Supercedes and Replaces are no longer used.

   Updates

      To be used as a reference from a new item that cannot be used
      alone (i.e., one that supplements a previous document), to refer
      to the previous document.  The newer publication is a part that
      will supplement or be added on to the existing document; e.g., an
      addendum, or separate, extra information that is to be added to
      the original document.

   Obsoletes

      To be used to refer to an earlier document that is replaced by
      this document.  This document contains either revised information,
      or else all of the same information plus some new information,
      however extensive or brief that new information is; i.e., this
      document can be used alone, without reference to the older
      document.











Postel & Reynolds            Informational                     [Page 12]

RFC 2223              Instructions to RFC Authors           October 1997


      For example:

         On the Assigned Numbers RFCs the term Obsoletes should be used
         since the new document actually incorporate new information
         (however brief) into the text of existing information and is
         more up-to-date than the older document, and hence, replaces it
         and makes it Obsoletes.

   In lists of RFCs or the RFC-Index (but not on the RFCs themselves)
   the following may be used with early documents to point to later
   documents.

   Obsoleted-by

      To be used to refer to the newer document(s) that replaces the
      older document.

   Updated-by

      To be used to refer to the newer section(s) which are to be added
      to the existing, still used, document.

13.  Protocol Standards Process

   See the current "Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) memo
   for the definitive statement on protocol standards and their
   publication [1].

   The established procedure is that when the IESG completes work on a
   document that is to become a standards track RFC the communication
   will be from the Secretary of the IESG to the RFC Editor.  Generally,
   the documents in question are Internet Drafts.  The communication
   usually cites the exact Internet Draft (by file name) in question.
   The RFC Editor must assume that only that file is to be processed to
   become the RFC.  If the authors have small corrections to the text,
   they should be sent to the RFC Editor separately (or as a "diff"), do
   not send a new version of the document.

14.  Contact

   To contact the RFC Editor send an email message to:

         "rfc-editor@isi.edu".

15.  Distribution Lists

   The RFC announcements are distributed via two mailing lists: the
   "IETF-Announce" list, and the "RFC-DIST" list.  You don't want to be
   on both lists.

   To join (or quit) the IETF-Announce list send a message to ietf-
   request@ietf.org.

   To join (or quit) the RFC-DIST list send a message to rfc-dist-
   request@isi.edu.

16.  RFC Index

   Several organizations maintain RFC Index files, generally using the
   file name "rfc-index.txt".  The contents of such a file copied from
   one site may not be identical to that copied from another site.

17.  Security Considerations

   This RFC raises no security issues (however, see Section 9).

20.  Appendix - RFC "nroff macros"

   Generally, we use the very simplest nroff features.  We use the "ms"
   macros.  So, "nroff -ms input-file > output-file".  However, we could
   not get nroff to do the right thing about putting a form feed after
   the last visible line on a page and no extra line feeds before the
   first visible line of the next page.  We want:

        last visible line on page i
        ^L
        first visible line on page i+1

   So, we invented a hack to fix this.  We use a perl script called
   "fix.pl".  So the command to process the file becomes:

        nroff -ms input-file | fix.pl > output-file

   The actual perl script is:


#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#! /local/bin/perl

# fix.pl  17-Nov-93  Craig Milo Rogers at USC/ISI
#
#       The style guide for RFCs calls for pages to be delimited by the
# sequence <last-non-blank-line><formfeed-line><first-non-blank-line>.
# Unfortunately, NROFF is reluctant to produce output that conforms to
# this convention.  This script fixes RFC-style documents by searching
# for the token "FORMFEED[Page", replacing "FORMFEED" with spaces,
# appending a formfeed line, and deleting white space up to the next
# non-white space character.
#
#       There is one difference between this script's output and that of
# the "fix.sh" and "pg" programs it replaces:  this script includes a
# newline after the formfeed after the last page in a file, whereas the
# earlier programs left a bare formfeed as the last character in the
# file.  To obtain bare formfeeds, uncomment the second substitution
# command below.  To strip the final formfeed, uncomment the third
# substitution command below.
#
#       This script is intended to run as a filter, as in:
#
# nroff -ms input-file | fix.pl > output-file
#
#       When porting this script, please observe the following points:
#
# 1)    ISI keeps perl in "/local/bin/perl";  your system may keep it

#    s/\f\n$/\f/;                       # Want bare formfeed at end?
#    s/\f\n$//;                         # Want no formfeed at end?
    print;                              # Print the resultant file.

A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers

Status of this Memo

.fi
.in 3
This memo describes an experimental method for the encapsulation of IP
datagrams in avian carriers.  This specification is primarily useful
in Metropolitan Area Networks.  This is an experimental, not recommended
standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

.ti 0
Overview and Rational

Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low
altitude service.  The connection topology is limited to a single
point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers, but
many carriers can be used without significant interference with each
other, outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D ether space
available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by
IEEE802.3.  The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance system,
which increases availability.  Unlike some network technologies, such
as packet radio, communication is not limited to line-of-sight
distance.  Connection oriented service is available in some cities,
usually based upon a central hub topology.

Frame Format

The IP datagram is printed, on a small scroll of paper, in
hexadecimal, with each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff.
The scroll of paper is wrapped around one leg of the avian carrier.
A band of duct tape is used to secure the datagram's edges.  The
bandwidth is limited to the leg length.  The MTU is variable, and
paradoxically, generally increases with increased carrier age.  A
typical MTU is 256 milligrams.  Some datagram padding may be needed.

Upon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper copy of the
datagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittable
form.

Discussion

Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized pecking
order.  An additional property is built-in worm detection and
eradication.  Because IP only guarantees best effort delivery, loss of
a carrier can be tolerated.  With time, the carriers are
self-regenerating.  While broadcasting is not specified, storms can
cause data loss.  There is persistent delivery retry, until the
carrier drops.  Audit trails are automatically generated, and can
often be found on logs and cable trays.

Security Considerations

.in 3
Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special
measures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers
are used in a tactical environment.
